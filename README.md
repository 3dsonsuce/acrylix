Acrylix is a universal multi-game script that compiles simple yet powerful code into 1 GUI.
The main script for KFC BUCKET since 2022, led by its owner tomfooler.

Created with the help of many scripters, such as Thepresent, Nekai, kfcmare, and many more.

Script:
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://github.com/3dsonsuce/acrylix/raw/main/Acrylix'))() 

Please note that compatibility varies, thus this script is ideally used when you can't find a proper script for a game you like. No features here are designed for a specific game, meaning you just have to try your luck and see if any features of Acrylix work on it.
